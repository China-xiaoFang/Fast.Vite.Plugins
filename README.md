Composable Vite plugins for code generation, build information, asset processing and deployment checks.

**[Documentation](http://docs.fastdotnet.cn/en-US/frontend/vite-plugins/) · [Official website](http://fastdotnet.com)**

## Highlights

- ESM-only package with Vite as its only peer dependency and no runtime dependencies.
- Web-application-first scope covering development, HTML, assets, security, observability, and production quality gates.
- One feature-named function per plugin: import and configure only what your project needs.
- Deterministic generators that avoid rewriting unchanged output.
- Output-boundary validation, debounced watchers, watcher cleanup, and clear conflict diagnostics.
- TypeScript 6 strict checks, type-aware ESLint 10, public API type tests, Node tests, and a real Vite build test.
- Vite 7 and 8 support on Node.js `^22.18.0 || ^24.18.0`.

## Plugins

| API                    | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `componentRegistry`    | Generate Vue component exports and global types         |
| `routerMeta`           | Generate a route-file to component-name JSON map        |
| `svgIcons`             | Generate independent Vue icon components and an index   |
| `cdnImport`            | Map ESM imports to CDN-provided browser globals         |
| `buildInfo`            | Emit build metadata, a dev endpoint, and virtual module |
| `bundleBudget`         | Enforce per-file or total raw/compressed size budgets   |
| `compression`          | Emit gzip and Brotli precompressed assets               |
| `subresourceIntegrity` | Inject SRI hashes for local JavaScript and CSS          |
| `devRestart`           | Restart dev when external configuration files change    |
| `staticCopy`           | Safely copy or transform build-time static assets       |
| `virtualModules`       | Declare static or dynamic virtual ESM modules           |
| `envGuard`             | Validate environment variables without logging values   |
| `htmlTemplate`         | Replace escaped HTML placeholders and inject tags       |

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -D fast-vite-plugins
```

The consuming project must use an ESM Vite configuration and Vite 7 or 8.

## Quick start

Enable only the plugins needed by the application in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { compression } from "fast-vite-plugins";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [compression({ algorithms: ["gzip", "brotli"], threshold: 10 * 1024 })],
});
```

This emits precompressed files only. The server must still select them using `Accept-Encoding`; deployment settings are not changed automatically.

## Operational notes

- `svgIcons` writes SVG markup directly into generated Vue TSX components. Enable Vue JSX/TSX transformation in the consuming project and only scan trusted repository assets.
- The SRI plugin hashes local build outputs. Pin CDN versions and provide integrity metadata for remote CDN resources separately.
- Precompression emits `.gz` and `.br`; your server or object storage must serve them based on `Accept-Encoding`.
- When using SRI, budgets, and precompression together, keep this order in `plugins`: SRI → budgets → compression.
- This repository publishes an npm library. Deploy the consuming application's built `dist/`, not this repository.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
```

Use `pnpm dev` for a long-running tsdown watch build while editing plugins.

The repository root is the public npm package. `pnpm build` writes only to the ignored root `dist/` directory, and package inspection or publishing runs from the repository root with pnpm.
